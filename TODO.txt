Add book constaints 
Function implementation
    main.search_author
        returns an autofill of the first letter if in library.
        I want to return an autofill of all authors with the current input:
            Ex: type "g" return all "g%"
    library.remove_book
    library.search_author
Implement "physical"/"digital" string when writing format data when typing "p" or "d" 
    same thing for storage locations "S1" = "Shelf 1" 
Implement abstract.py for abstract data structure use
    Implement ADTs (BST, )
    learn implementation
Keep track of books at home 

Completed:
    # now reads file data correctly
    main.display_books
        currenly prints only the hardcoded data 
    # now stores information in LMS.txt file and loads data into shelf list correctly
    Store book information into LMS.txt w/o overwriting
    check if information is the same:
        if so, add only the new data
    # Successful implementation:
        libarary.search_title
