The following is R1's work:

1. main.py
    This will be the entry point of your application.

    It will handle the main menu and user interactions, such as adding, updating, deleting, or searching for books.

2. book.py
    This file will define the Book class.

    The class will store attributes like title, author, ISBN, publication year, format (physical/digital), and any other relevant details.

3. library.py
    This file will define the Library class.

    It will manage a collection of Book objects and provide methods for adding, removing, searching, and listing books.

4. LMS.txt
    This file will store books and its relevant information.

Optional Files:
    cli.py: If you want to create a command-line interface (CLI) for your system, you can separate the CLI logic into this file.

    gui.py: If you plan to create a graphical user interface (GUI), this file will contain the GUI logic using a library like Tkinter or PyQt.

Suggested Data Storage Format:

    For more advanced projects, consider using a lightweight database like SQLite.
